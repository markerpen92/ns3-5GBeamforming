< Each Probe can try to listen to other classes traces (e.g., ``ns3::Ipv4FlowProbe``
< will try to use any ``ns3::NetDevice`` trace named ``TxQueue/Drop``) but this
< is something that the user should not rely into blindly, because the trace is not
< guaranteed to be in every type of ``ns3::NetDevice``. As an example,
< ``CsmaNetDevice`` and ``PointToPointNetDevice`` have a ``TxQueue/Drop`` trace, while

< The "lost" packets problem
< ##########################
< 
< At the end of a simulation, Flow Monitor could report about "lost" packets, i.e.,
< packets that Flow Monitor have lost track of.
< 
< It is important to keep in mind that Flow Monitor records the packets statistics by
< intercepting them at a given network level - let's say at IP level. When the simulation
< ends, any packet queued for transmission below the IP level will be considered as lost.
< 
< It is strongly suggested to consider this point when using Flow Monitor. The user can choose to:
< 
< * Ignore the lost packets (if their number is a statistically irrelevant quantity), or
< * Stop the Applications before the actual Simulation End time, leaving enough time between the two for the queued packets to be processed.
< 
< The second method is the suggested one. Usually a few seconds are enough (the
< exact value depends on the network type).
< 
< It is important to stress that "lost" packets could be anywhere in the network, and could count
< toward the received packets or the dropped ones. Ideally, their number should be zero or a minimal
< fraction of the other ones, i.e., they should be "statistically irrelevant".
